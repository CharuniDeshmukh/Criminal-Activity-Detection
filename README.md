# Criminal Activity Detection

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

We propose a solution for that and came with an idea where the violence or certain criminal activity can only be detected and the result of that will be send to the nearest police control room, by using Deep Learning and some Machine Learning concepts.

We trained our dataset on some parameters so that, if the inter body distance hit the pivot point(set by us through analysis of video frames), and marked hitter (or with the name of the person if his/her photo matches with the police criminal dataset) the person who takes the action first and marked the other one as a victim.

Our model is an example of multi levelled classification problem. Where the model will be able to detect multiple victims and attackers or violent activity done by the peoples. We'll use cloud computing for data storage, data transferring and controlling, which will be sent by our model. The main focus of this model is to detect the unwanted criminal or any violence activities and send an alert to the nearest control room with a message.
